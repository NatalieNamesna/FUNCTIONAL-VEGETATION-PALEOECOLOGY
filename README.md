# FUNCTIONAL VEGETATION PALEOECOLOGY FOSSILPOL
The central objective of this project is to link global fossil pollen records with contemporary plant functional trait data to investigate how ecosystem functions have shifted since the Last Glacial Maximum. Specifically, the project will:

A) connect global fossil pollen assemblages with key contemporary plant traits related to growth, survival, and reproduction; B) estimate Community Weighted Means (CWMs) for each spatio-temporal sample; C) quantify ecosystem dynamics at multiple spatial scales, from local biomes to the global level; and D) attribute community-level trait composition to climatic variability and anthropogenic impact.
